### 6. `6_Image_Classification.ipynb`
**Animal Faces Classification**  
Image classification based on the AFHQ dataset with 16,130 high-resolution animal face images from three categories:
- Cat
- Dog
- Wildlife

### 7. `7_Pre-trained_Models_Image_Classification.ipynb`
**Bean Leaf Lesion Detection (GoogLeNet)**  
Image classification using a pre-trained GoogLeNet model to detect three leaf states:
- Healthy
- Angular leaf spot
- Bean rust

### 8. `8_Audio_Classification.ipynb`
**Quran Recitation Audio Classification**  
Audio classification task using Quran recitations recorded by various reciters. The dataset includes WAV files organized by speaker, recorded in different acoustic conditions.

---

### 9. `9_Text_Classification.ipynb`
**Sarcasm Detection in News Headlines (BERT)**  
Text classification using a fine-tuned BERT model (`google-bert/bert-base-uncased`) to detect sarcasm in news headlines. The dataset includes:
- Sarcastic headlines from *The Onion*
- Real headlines from *HuffPost*
